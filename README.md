Part of [Student Veterans Life Cycle Atlus](https://atlas.studentveterans.org/). Created by Madeline Clark at [Student Veterans of America](https://studentveterans.org/).

A sunburst diagram showing the paths of veterans post-high school. Each node indicates a sequential stage in one's life, going up to eight stages.

Reads in different hierarchical JSON files based on dropdown menu selection.

Designed based initially on [kerryrodden's sequential sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426).

Written in [D3.js v4](https://d3js.org/).

Known Issues:
* Education is currently being updates; the Graduate chart is missing and the Doctorate chart is only showing partial results
* Not every sunburst option is up-to-date; some still show the early survey results (n = 1207) and need to be updated to reflect new totals
