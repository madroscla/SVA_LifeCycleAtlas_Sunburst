Last updated 07 February 2020.

Part of [Student Veterans Life Cycle Atlas](https://atlas.studentveterans.org/). Created by Madeline Clark at [Student Veterans of America](https://studentveterans.org/).

A sunburst diagram showing the paths of veterans post-high school. Each node indicates a sequential stage in one's life, going up to eight stages.

Reads in different hierarchical JSON files based on dropdown menu selection.

Design based initially on [kerryrodden's sequential sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426).

Written in [D3.js v4](https://d3js.org/).

Major updates:
* All sunbursts/JSON files represent the full survey results (n = 3750)
* Scrollbars are enabled to allow for zooming/different screen resolutions
* Tooltip explanations of each path in the legend (tooltips based on [d3noob's code](https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369))
* Short subtitle briefly explaining each diagram
